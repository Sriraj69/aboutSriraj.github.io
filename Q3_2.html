        <p>Being a curious kid, I tended to learn a lot of things from my childhood. I learnt cubing after watching my friends in school compete with their skills. I quickly learnt 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 and used to measure the times of my solves. The happiness in my face was immeasurable whenever I beat my personal best. It was something else whenever I beat my friends in competitions. I also learnt the 3x3 megaminx, 3x3 pyraminx and still will continue to learn more.<br>My other hobbies include sleeping for a lot of time and also fidgeting using whatever that is in my hand at that moment. </p>
