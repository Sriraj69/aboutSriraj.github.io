        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <div class="content">
        <p>I am a IInd year B.Tech Undergraduate from the department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering in IIT Madras. I am a startup enthusiast who tries to keep up with all the news of startups' progress and their advancements. I am also an aspiring Product Manager that is learning the very essentials of Product Development and Management but yet to experience the learnings in real life.<br>Working as a Project Management Coordinator in Nirmaan IITM, I am learning how startups grow from idea to a product or a service. Helping them with their queries and solving their problems gave me insights on what problems we can face and how we can face them while building our own startups. Interacting and interviewing the startup founders help me getting an internship in their startups. <br>I am currently exploring various avenues to see where a venture can be established in that. Hopefully I will be able to accomplish it as soon as possible.</p>
